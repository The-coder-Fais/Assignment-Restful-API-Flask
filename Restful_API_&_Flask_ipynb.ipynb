        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It's an architectural style for designing networked applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "A RESTful API adheres to REST principles, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resources are identified by URLs, and interactions are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an API Specification?\n",
        "\n",
        "An API specification is a formal document that describes the functionality of an API, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "It serves as a contract between the API provider and consumers, ensuring consistency and clarity in how the API should behave.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask Framework Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, designed to make it easy to build web applications and APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's termed a \"micro\" framework because it doesn't include built-in tools like form validation or database abstraction, allowing developers to choose their tools and libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is popular for building APIs due to its simplicity, scalability, and the vast ecosystem of extensions available.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is Routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Routing in Flask refers to the mechanism that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific functions (views) in your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each route is associated with a URL pattern and an HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), determining how the application responds to different requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the Purpose of the @app.route() Decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to bind a function to a specific URL pattern and HTTP method.\n",
        "\n",
        "It simplifies the process of defining routes by associating a URL with a function that handles the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the Purpose of Flask's jsonify() Function?\n",
        "\n",
        "The jsonify() function in Flask is used to convert Python dictionaries or lists into JSON responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "It sets the appropriate MIME type (application/json) and ensures proper formatting of the JSON output.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Explain Flask’s url_for() Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The url_for() function in Flask generates a URL for a given endpoint, allowing for dynamic URL creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's particularly useful for generating links to static files or for redirecting to other views within the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How Does Flask Handle Static Files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask serves static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) from a folder named static by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "These files are accessible via a URL path, and Flask handles their delivery to the client without the need for additional configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP Methods and Status Codes\n",
        "9. What Are HTTP Methods Used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs include:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "PUT: Update existing data on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE: Remove data from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "PATCH: Apply partial modifications to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What Are HTTP Status Codes, and Why Are They Important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are grouped into categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "2xx: Success (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created)\n",
        "\n",
        "3xx: Redirection\n",
        "\n",
        "4xx: Client errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)\n",
        "\n",
        "5xx: Server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)\n",
        "\n",
        "Using appropriate status codes helps clients understand the outcome of their requests and handle responses accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What Is the Difference Between GET and POST HTTP Methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "GET is used to retrieve data from the server without causing any side effects.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. What Are Flask Blueprints, and How Are They Useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask Blueprints allow you to organize your application into modules, each with its own routes, templates, and static files.\n",
        "\n",
        "They promote a modular structure, making it easier to manage and scale large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What Is the Purpose of Flask's Request Object?\n",
        "\n",
        "The request object in Flask contains all the information about the current HTTP request, including form data, query parameters, headers, and the request method.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to access and process incoming data in your views.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What Is the Role of Flask’s Session Object?\n",
        "\n",
        "The session object in Flask is used to store data that should persist across requests from the same user, such as user authentication status.\n",
